The Odin Project – RoR APIs – [Kittens](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api#building-a-kittens-api)

The goal of this project is to set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API.

This is a fast and straightforward project where you’ll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API… which is just a fancy way of saying that all your controller methods will render data instead of HTML. Consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. We won’t be working with an external API until the next project.
